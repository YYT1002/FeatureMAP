# FeatureMAP: Enhanced Manifold Learning for Single-Cell Data

Visualizing single-cell data is crucial for understanding cellular heterogeneity and dynamics. Traditional methods like UMAP and t-SNE are effective for clustering but often miss critical gene information. FeatureMAP innovatively combines UMAP and PCA concepts to preserve both clustering structures and gene feature variations within a low-dimensional space.

## Description

FeatureMAP introduces a novel approach by enhancing manifold learning with pairwise tangent space embedding, aiming to retain crucial aspects of cellular data. It presents three core concepts:
1. **Gene Contribution**: Estimating and projecting gene feature loadings.
2. **Gene Variation Trajectory**: Tracking the differential expression and variation across states.
3. **Core and Transition States**: Defined computationally through density-preserving capabilities.

These enhancements allow for differential gene variation analysis, highlighting key regulatory genes that drive transitions between cellular states. Tested on both synthetic and real single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, including studies on pancreatic development and T-cell exhaustion, FeatureMAP provides a more detailed understanding of cellular trajectories and regulatory mechanisms.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
FeatureMAP uses the following dependency:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Required Python libraries: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, umap-learn, scikit-learn, numba (>= 0.55.0)

### Installation

PyPi installation
